Project Description
This lab builds on the previous project by adding interactivity using JavaScript. The completed features include a theme toggle button that switches between light and dark mode, a contact form with validation and a personalized response message, a “Back to Top” button for easier navigation, and an FAQ section where answers toggle on click. Additionally, user data is dynamically loaded using the Fetch API and displayed in a list. These enhancements improve usability and demonstrate core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation and events.
